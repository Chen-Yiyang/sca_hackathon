# SCA hackathon

## Object Detection Model 
The insect dataset is from [https://github.com/xpwu95/IP102](https://github.com/xpwu95/IP102), with a total of 18k images of 101 classes of common bugs/insects. For each image, the bounding box as well as the class label of the insect are provided. For quick prototyping of this hackathon, only first 20 classes with a total of 3.6k images are used.
